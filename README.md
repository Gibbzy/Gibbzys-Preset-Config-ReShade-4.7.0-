# Gibbzys-Preset-Config-ReShade-4.7.0-
Texture improvement, Natural Lights Source and more!
With fully customized source codes (.FH/.FHX) here is a Config for your reshade that tries to mimic some of the features that current graphics engines have naturally in Rigs of Rods for better experience in your gameplay and for your screenshots!

This config has 22 effects to be enabled by CTRL+F2, and also it has a depth of field that can be enabled by CTRL+Z, and focuses wherever the mouse is or even wherever are you looking at. So if it is annoying you this can be changed by pressing unchecking "Matsodof.fx" and "ADOF.fx". Too much blur in your Speedometer UI? This also can be changed by pressing unchecking "Tiltshift".

OPTIONAL
