# Gibbzys-Preset-Config-ReShade-4.7.0-

(Son release of the source code)

Texture improvement, Natural Lights Source you'll find here!
With fully customized source codes (.FH/.FHX) here is a Config for your reshade that tries to mimic some of the features that current graphics engines have naturally in Rigs of Rods for better experience in your gameplay and for your screenshots!

This config has 28 effects to be enabled by CTRL+F2, and also it has a depth of field that can be enabled by CTRL+Z, and focuses wherever the mouse is or even wherever are you looking at. So if it is annoying you this can be changed by pressing unchecking "Matsodof.fx" and "ADOF.fx". Too much blur in your Speedometer UI? This also can be changed by pressing unchecking "Tiltshift".

OPTIONAL

Ctrl+B Tracking Rays

Ctrl+A qUINT.ssr

Installation:
Place Zy_Config.ini into your installation directory (usually C:\Program Files\Rigs of Rods)

The ReShade FX shading language is heavily based on the DX9-style HLSL syntax, with a few extensions. For more details on HLSL, check out the Programming Guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-writing-shaders-9 .
This document will instead primarily focus on syntax and features that are unique to ReShade FX.
